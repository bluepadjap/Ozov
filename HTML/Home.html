				<p>Still finding who I am. Pretty elusive.
				Don't get me wrong. I know what I stand for; I have my morals my principles, my driving motivations.
				But this is a page for my skills and work ethics and ethos.
				And that's where the dilemma comes in!
				Enough rambling and wool gathering.
				Look right for my accomplishments and skills!</p>

				<p>I am a hardworking (if motivated), honest individual with high standards. I possess good ethics as well as very good intercommunication and collaborative skills (according to plum.io and www.16personalities.com). I do believe I also possess a good amount of emotional intelligence.<p>
				<p>I am working to develop my Web Development skills (I mean I have redone HTML turorials over and over again. Have to do something!) and this site is a product of my skills (If it looks good we have a winner, if not; FAIILLLLL!)</p>
